            <h3>How To Apply</h3>
            <p>
              We have a three step admission process. The first step is to
              submit an application. After your application has been submitted
              and reviewed, you may be invited to an interview. Your interview
              will be tailored to your childâ€™s personality and cognitive level
              and is designed to learn more about your child in the context of a
              conversation. Older students are required to undertake a common
              entrance test. Finally, we ask that you assemble and prepare a
              variety of materials like your school report cards, birth
              certificate and Aadhar.

            2. Interview and Common Entrance Test
          </h2>
          <p className="howto-start-head2">
            Once online application forms and required documents have been
            received, candidates are invited to our campus to get to know the
            school and to take a common entrance test in mathematics, english
            and hindi. They are interviewed by academic heads and they have the
            chance to ask questions.
          </p>
          <p className="howto-start-head2">
            If the student is not invited for an interview, this will bring the
            admissions process to an end. If the student is invited to the
            school for an interview and testing, we would normally arrange a
            time and date for a visit, during which time a tour of the school
            would also be given. No entrance test will be conducted for students
            from playgroup to grade three, however, they may undergo an
            interview to assess their personality and cognitive level.
          </p>
          <p className="howto-start-head2">
            <b>Disclaimer: </b>Children develop fairly quickly over the course
            of a year and all candidates who are refused an admission or a place
            can always reapply for the following year. To increase their chances
            of admission, applicants are encouraged to apply as early as
            possible after the month of February.
