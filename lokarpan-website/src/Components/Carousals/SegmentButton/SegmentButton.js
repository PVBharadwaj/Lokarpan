                </p>
                <p>
                  Once we review the completed application materials,
                  shortlisted students will receive an email or phone call
                  informing you whether or not the applicant will be invited for

                  the admission process follows a first in first out queue.

                <h3>Application Decision</h3>
                <p>
                  For applicants, as soon as the form is submitted, the
                  admissions exam corrected and the application fee paid, our
                  admissions committee reviews each application and arrives at
                  one of the following decisions:
                </p>

                <ul className="segment-list">
                  <li>Acceptance</li>
                  <li>Deferral</li>
                  <li>Waiting List</li>

                  <b>Note:</b> The turnaround time from a completed application
                  to decision is usually one week.
                </p>

                <h3>Understanding the decisions </h3>
                <p>Four decisions are possible:</p>
                <ul className="segment-list">
                  <li>Acceptance and an offer is made to the candidate</li>
                  <li>
                    In some cases, the admission decision may be deferred
                    because of competition for the applied class. In such cases,
                    parents or guardians are informed of when a decision can be
                    expected and the date when the application will be reviewed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Waiting list means that candidates have the qualities to be
                    admitted but that there are currently no places left for
                    technical reasons i.e, the class is full. If the situation
                    changes, parents are informed and decide whether to accept
                    the place
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Denial which means that a candidate cannot come to the Kith
                    n Kin School in the following September; the application
                    can, however be carried over into the next academic year
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  <b>Note:</b> There is a limited number of seats at Kith and
                  even the most brilliant and well qualified students may not be
                  admitted if there is no room. The Kith n Kin school never
                  accepts donations. While the school may depend on the parents
                  and alumni and donorsâ€™ generosity, no contributions are
                  considered as guarantees or substitutes for the application
                  and assessment process.
