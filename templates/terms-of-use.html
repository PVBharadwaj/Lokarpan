        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 60px;">1.1&nbsp;<u>Account</u>. In order to use certain features of the Website, you
        must register for an account. You may be asked to provide a password in connection with your account. You
        are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and You agree to
        accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You agree that the
        information You provide to Lokarpan, whether at registration or at any other time, will be true, accurate,
        current, and complete. You also agree that You will ensure that this information is kept accurate and
        up-to-date at all times. If You have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure (e.g., in the
        event of a loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure or use of your account ID or password), then You agree to
        immediately notify Lokarpan at info@lokarpan.com. You may be liable for the losses incurred by Lokarpan or
        others due to any unauthorized use of your Website account.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 60px;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 60px;">1.2&nbsp;<u>Integrated Service</u>. Lokarpan may permit You to register for the
        Website through, or otherwise associate your Lokarpan ID account with, certain third party social networking
        or integrated services, such as Facebook Connect and Google (&ldquo;Integrated Service&rdquo;). By
        registering for the Website using (or otherwise granting access to) an Integrated Service, you agree that
        Lokarpan may access your Integrated Service&rsquo;s account information, and you agree to any and all terms
        and conditions of the Integrated Service regarding your use of the Website via the Integrated Service. You
        agree that any Integrated Service is a Reference Site (as defined below) and you are solely responsible for
        your interactions with the Integrated Service as a result of accessing the Website through the Integrated
        Service. Lokarpan does not control the practices of Integrated Services, and you are advised to read the
        Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of any Integrated Service that you use to understand their
        practices.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 60px;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 60px;">1.3&nbsp;<u>Child User</u>. If You are a User of the Website and are under the
        age of 13 (&ldquo;Child User&rdquo;), You may not register an account for the Website without consent and
        approval from your legal parent or guardian. A Child User that begins the registration process for himself
        or herself without a Parent User may have the registration process restricted until a Parent User approves
        or assumes responsibility for the Child User account. Additionally, a Child User may use the Website if
        registered through certain educational organizations or, in certain cases (as defined below), by Coaches
        that have entered into a relationship directly with Lokarpan and through which education organization or
        Coach the legal parent and/or guardian of such Child User has consented to use of the Website. Further, in
        certain instances, a Child User may use our Website via one of the third party applications that integrate
        into or with the Website. A Child User that has registered through such external educational organizations,
        third party applications, or Coaches will only be permitted to use the Website for so long as Lokarpan
        reasonably believes that such access has been consented to by the Child User&rsquo;s parent or guardian.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 60px;">1.4&nbsp;<u>Teacher</u>. Lokarpan may make available certain features and tools
        that permit certain Users (such as, for example, representatives of school districts, schools, teachers, and
        other educators) to work with students and other Users through the Website in order to provide such students
        and other Users with tutorial, educational and other education-related services, and to review and evaluate
        educational achievement and progress of such students and other Users (each a &ldquo;Teacher&rdquo;). If you
        are a Teacher, you must use Lokarpan&rsquo;s Teacher registration process when registering accounts on the
        Website for one or more of your students. IF YOU ARE A TEACHER AND YOU REGISTER AN ACCOUNT FOR A CHILD USER,
        YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED EXPRESS CONSENT FROM SUCH CHILD USER&rsquo;S PARENT OR
        LEGAL GUARDIAN FOR YOU TO REGISTER THE CHILD USER FOR THE WEBSITE AND FOR YOU TO PROVIDE TO LOKARPAN THE
        INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE REGISTRATION OF SUCH CHILD USER. WITHOUT LIMITING THE
        FOREGOING, YOU FURTHER AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF SUCH CHILD USER, INCLUDING WITHOUT
        LIMITATION BEING LIABLE FOR ALL USE OF THE WEBSITE BY THE CHILD USER, FOR SO LONG AS THE CHILD USER IS NOT
        OTHERWISE ASSOCIATED WITH OR ASSUMED BY A VALID PARENT USER ACCOUNT. You hereby agree to indemnify, defend
        and hold harmless Lokarpan against any and all claims, losses, liabilities and expenses (including
        reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) arising out of or related to (a) your violation of any provision,
        representation or warranty this Section 1.4; (b) the use of the Website by the Child User; (c) your failure
        to obtain sufficient parental or legal guardian consent; (d) your registration of the Child User, or (e) any
        other action related to the Child User.<br/></p>
    <ol start="2">
        <li>Privacy Policy. Your privacy is important to us. Please read the LokarpanPrivacy Policy, hereby
            incorporated into the Terms, carefully for information relating to Lokarpan&rsquo;s collection, use, and
            disclosure of Your personal information.<br/></li>
        <li>API Terms; Other guidelines.</li>
    </ol>
    <p style="padding-left: 60px;">3.1&nbsp;<u>API Terms</u>. Users who utilize any of Lokarpan&rsquo;s application
        programming interfaces (&ldquo;APIs&rdquo;) additionally agree to be bound by Lokarpan&rsquo;s API&nbsp;Terms
        of Service.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 60px;">3.2&nbsp;<u>Other Guidelines</u>. When using the Website, You will be subject to
        any additional posted guidelines or rules applicable to specific services and features which may be posted

        into the Terms.<br/></p>
    <ol start="4">
        <li>Modification of the Terms. Lokarpan reserves the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or
            remove portions of the Terms at any time. Please check the Terms and any Guidelines periodically for
            changes. Your continued use of the Website after the posting of changes constitutes your binding
            acceptance of such changes. For any material changes to the Terms, Lokarpan will make reasonable effort
            to provide notice to you of such amended Terms, such as by an email notification to the address
            associated with your account or by posting a notice on the Website, and such amended terms will be
            effective against You on the earlier of (i) your actual notice of such changes and (ii) thirty days
            after Lokarpan makes reasonable attempt to provide you such notice. Disputes arising under these Terms
            will be resolved in accordance with the version of the Terms in place at the time the dispute
            arose.<br/></li>

        Website certain educational videos, exercises, and related supplementary materials that are owned by
        Lokarpan or its third-party licensors (the &ldquo;Licensed Educational Content&rdquo;). Lokarpan grants to

        available on the Website by Lokarpan solely for your personal, non-commercial purposes. Unless expressly
        indicated on the Website that a particular item of Licensed Educational Content is made available to Users
        under alternate license terms, you may not download, distribute, sell, lease, modify, or otherwise provide
        access to the Licensed Educational Content to any third party.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 60px;">(a)&nbsp;Alternate Licenses. In certain cases, Lokarpan or its licensors may make
        available Licensed Educational Content under alternate license terms, such as a variant of the Creative
        Commons License (as defined below) (each, an &ldquo;Alternate License&rdquo;). Where expressly indicated as
        such on the Website, and subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, the applicable Licensed
        Educational Content is licensed to You under the terms of the Alternate License. By using, downloading, or
        otherwise accessing such Licensed Educational Content, You agree to comply fully with all the terms and
        conditions of such Alternate License.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 60px;">6.3&nbsp;<u>Licensed Educational Code</u>. Lokarpan may make available, or allow
        Users to create and make available, on or through the Website certain educational, user-readable source code
        in connection with the &ldquo;Computer Science&rdquo; modules or exercises available on the Website (the

        property of Lokarpan or third-party licensors and, subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, is
        licensed to You under the terms of the MIT License. By downloading or otherwise accessing such Licensed
        Educational Code, You agree to comply with all the terms of the MIT License.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 60px;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 60px;">6.4&nbsp;<u>Non-Commercial Use</u>. The Licensed Educational Content and Licensed
        Educational Code are intended for personal, non-commercial use only. Without limiting the foregoing, and
        notwithstanding the terms of any Alternate License for such Licensed Educational Content, the Licensed
        Educational Content may not be used, distributed or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose,
        commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, unless otherwise previously agreed in writing by
        Lokarpan.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 60px;">(a)&nbsp;Impermissible Uses. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
        the following are types of uses that Lokarpan expressly defines as falling outside of &ldquo;non-commercial&rdquo;
        use:</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 60px;">the sale or rental of (1) any part of the Licensed Educational Content, (2) any
        derivative works based at least in part on the Licensed Educational Content, or (3) any collective work that
        includes any part of the Licensed Educational Content;</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 60px;">providing training, support, or editorial services that use or reference the
        Licensed Educational Content in exchange for a fee; and</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 60px;">iii. the sale of advertisements, sponsorships, or promotions placed on the
        Licensed Educational Content, or any part thereof, or the sale of advertisements, sponsorships, or
        promotions on any website or blog containing any part of the Licensed Educational Material, including
        without limitation any &ldquo;pop-up advertisements&rdquo;.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 60px;">(b)&nbsp;Use Characterization. Whether a particular use of the Licensed
        Educational Content is &ldquo;non-commercial&rdquo; depends on the use, not the user. Thus, a use of the
        Licensed Educational Content that does not require that users pay fees and that does not provide an entity
        with a commercial advantage is &ldquo;non-commercial,&rdquo; even if this use is by a commercial entity.
        Conversely, any use that involves charging users in connection with their access to the Licensed Educational
        Content is not &ldquo;non-commercial,&rdquo; even if this use is by a non-profit entity. As an example, a
        for-profit corporation&rsquo;s use of the Licensed Educational Content for internal professional development
        or training of employees is permitted, so long as the corporation charges no fees, directly or indirectly,
        for such use. Conversely, as another example, a non-profit entity&rsquo;s use of the Licensed Educational
        Content in connection with an fee-based training or educational program is NOT &ldquo;non-commercial&rdquo;
        and is not permitted.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 60px;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 60px;">6.5&nbsp;<u>Crediting Lokarpan</u>. If You distribute, publicly perform or
